 <p1>I Live in West London. I was born here and have lived here my whole life</p1><br>
 <p1>It is a nice and residential area that has many trasport links to get around</p1><br>
 <p1>However it is far away from Uni so it was a long commute to make it into lectures</p1><br><br>
 <p2>The city centre is much more lively and has many more people around</p2><br>
 <p2>Lots of tourists from around the world come and visit london</p2><br>
 <p2>It gets very busy and usually there is a lot of traffic during peak times</p2>
